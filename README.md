## üå± What is a Growth Mindset?

A growth mindset, a concept developed by Dr. Carol Dweck, is the belief that your abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication and hard work. It's not that talent doesn't matter, but that brains and talent are just the starting point. This mindset allows people to thrive during some of the most challenging times in their lives.

This app aims to help you practice and strengthen this valuable perspective.
